To create a GitHub repository and include the script, you'll follow these steps:

Step 1: Create a New GitHub Repository

1. Go to GitHub and log in to your account.


2. Click the New button or navigate to Repositories > New to create a new repository.


3. Name your repository (e.g., shizuku-termux-installer).


4. Optionally, add a description, set the repository to public or private, and choose to add a README if desired.


5. Click Create Repository.



Step 2: Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine (optional)

If you want to clone the repository to your local machine, open a terminal (or Termux on Android) and run the following commands:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/shizuku-termux-installer.git
cd shizuku-termux-installer

Step 3: Add the Script to GitHub

Option 1: Using the GitHub Website

1. Inside your new repository, click Add file > Create new file.


2. Name the file something like install_shizuku_termux.sh.


3. Paste the script content into the editor:



#!/bin/bash
# Ensure Shizuku is running and permissions are granted
adb shell shizuku ps

# Install APK using adb (via Shizuku)
APK_PATH="/storage/emulated/0/Download/your_app.apk"

if [[ -f "$APK_PATH" ]]; then
    echo "Installing $APK_PATH..."
    adb install "$APK_PATH" || echo "Installation failed."
else
    echo "APK not found at $APK_PATH"
fi

4. Scroll down and click Commit new file to save it.



Option 2: Using the Terminal (Git)

If you're working locally and have cloned the repository, navigate to the repository folder, create the script, and push it to GitHub:

1. Create the script file:

nano install_shizuku_termux.sh


2. Paste the script content into the file, then save and exit.


3. Add the file to your repository:

git add install_shizuku_termux.sh


4. Commit your changes:

git commit -m "Add Shizuku + Termux Installer script"


5. Push the changes to GitHub:

git push origin main



Step 4: Document Your Repository

1. Edit the README file or create one (README.md) in the repository to explain the purpose of the repository and provide instructions for running the script.



Example README content:

# Shizuku + Termux Installer Script

This repository contains a script to integrate **Shizuku** with **Termux** to perform elevated installations and other tasks without root access.

## How to Use

1. Install the **Shizuku** app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=moe.shizuku.privileged.api).
2. Follow the setup instructions within Shizuku to start its service.
3. Clone this repository to your local machine or Android device (with Termux installed).
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/shizuku-termux-installer.git

4. Navigate to the directory and make the script executable:

cd shizuku-termux-installer
chmod +x install_shizuku_termux.sh


5. Run the script to install APKs or manage permissions using Shizuku:

./install_shizuku_termux.sh



Notes

Ensure that Shizuku is running before executing the script.

Modify the script to point to the correct APK path for your application.


### Step 5: Share the Repository
Once your script and documentation are in place, share the link to your GitHub repository with others or use it yourself.
